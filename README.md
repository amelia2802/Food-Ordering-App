# Food-Ordering-App
Food ordering app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would allow users to browse a menu of available food items, select items to add to their cart, and submit their order for delivery or pickup. The app would likely use HTML to structure the layout and content of the pages, CSS to control the styling and visual design, and JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior.
